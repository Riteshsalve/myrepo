my first problem is done 

// Create a variable name to store your name
// Create a variable age to store your age
// Print the values stored in the variable on one line followed by the type of the variable in the next line
let Name = "Ritesh salve";
let age = 26;
console.log(Name,age);
console.log(typeof(Name));
console.log(typeof age);
